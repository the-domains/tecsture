Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) reserves the right to refuse any order. All goods are subject to availability.</p><p>All prices shown are correct at time of print and will remain valid until a new price list is issued. You shall pay the price for the goods as stated on Yuhei (Yuko-Europe)’s invoice and not as stated in any quotation, estimate or given orally.</p><p>All prices are quoted exclusive of VAT which, where applicable, will be charged in addition to the price quoted. Except where payment in advance is required, invoices are due for payment within 28 days of their date. Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) reserves the right to demand payment in advance on any order.</p><p>Without prejudice to any other remedy, Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) may charge interest on overdue invoices, from the due date until the date of payment, on a daily basis at the rate equivalent to an annual rate of 3% above the HSBC Bank (London) base lending rate then in force.</p><p>The goods in any consignment shall remain Yuhei (Yuko-Europe)’s property, even after delivery, until you have paid for them in full. Even though title to the goods has not passed to you, Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) shall be entitled to sue for their price once payment has become due.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that (a) any description which is given or applied to the goods (i) is only for the purpose of identifying the goods and (ii) shall not make this agreement a sale by description; and (b) where you have been shown and/or inspected a sample of the goods (i) the sole purpose of doing so was to enable you to judge the quality of the bulk and (ii) does not constitute a sale by sample.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that this agreement shall be on these terms and conditions to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions, including any such terms and conditions that are purported to be included or applied by you. No terms and conditions contained in any document supplied by you will form part of this agreement</p><h2>4 Delivery</h2><p>4.1 Delivery times which are quoted are target times only.

Where Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) agrees to arrange for transport and insurance it will do so as your agent and you shall reimburse the full costs of doing so to Yuhei (Yuko-Europe). If you require Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) to arrange for transport and insurance you must confirm this in writing at the time of making the order. If expedited delivery is agreed, an extra charge may be made to cover any additional costs incurred.<br>4.3 Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) may deliver in instalments and invoice for each instalment.</p><p>5. Law and jurisdiction The validity, construction and performance of this agreement shall be governed by English law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.<br>6 Entire Agreement This agreement contains the whole agreement between Yuhei (Yuko-Europe) and you in respect of the sale of the goods and supersedes any prior written or oral agreements, representations or understandings between us relating to such. The parties confirm that they have not entered into this agreement on the basis of any representation that is not expressly incorporated into this agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither party shall have any remedy in respect of any untrue statement made to it upon which it may have relied on in entering into this agreement, and a party’s only remedy is for breach of contract. However, nothing in this agreement purports to exclude liability for fraud.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">tecsture</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
